## Learn More

Dashboard basics are discussed on the [flexdashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) homepage.  For the workshop, I recommend experimenting with the  basic layout.  Later, explore [other layouts](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/layouts.html) with new dashboards. 

Then add ...  

- A code chunk demonstrating simple literate code (e.g. `plot(cars`)
- Inline code suing back-ticks and prose.  (e.g. `r` `length(cars$speed)`)
- Some [value boxes](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html#value_boxes) or [gauges](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html#value_boxes)
