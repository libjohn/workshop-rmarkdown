## Notebooks

Use R Notebooks for development.  Notebooks are self contained and can be emailed as a single document, like a MS Word file.

1. `File > New File > R Notebook`

## HTML Documents

Use HTML documents for more fixed content.  HTML Documents will cache better and potentially load faster.

1. `File > New File > R Markdown... > Document > HTML`
