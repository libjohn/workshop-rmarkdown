```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Get Started

Create a new R Markdown document from the File Menu

In RStudio...


1. `New File -> R Markdown -> Document ->PDF`
1. Generate some Literate Code
1. Knit (Knit to Word)


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("images/pdf_05_newdoc.png") 
``` 


The challenge with PDF files is generating your tables with `kintr::kable`.  There's also a kableExtra package if you need more functionality with editing your tables.




```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
