&nbsp;

1. `New File -> R Markdown -> Document ->Word`
1. Generate some Literate Code
1. Knit (Knit to Word)



The challenge with MS Word files is generating your tables with `kintr::kable`.  There's also a kableExtra package if you need more functionality with editing your tables.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
