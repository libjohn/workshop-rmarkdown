## Load Packages

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


Are Duke Slides loaded?

```{r}
library(dukeslides)
```

If not, follow the installation instructions

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("libjohn/dukeslides"
```

## Get Started
Create a new R Markdown document from the File menu

In RStudioâ€¦

1. `New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Slide template for Duke University {dukeslides}`
1. Click the `Knit` button to compile the slide into rendered HTML

Knitting will generate a slide deck with doubles as both a demonstration and documentation.

Edit to your hearts delight.  You can mess it up because if you re-execute step one, above, you'll have a new set of demonstration/instructions
